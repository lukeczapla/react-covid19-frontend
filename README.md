Code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The program includes components for infection modelling with the HTML5 canvas (react-plotly) and modifications of a simple tic-tac-toe example.
## Available Scripts

### `update`

This is for building the production code and moving it into the main webapp folder for deployment.

### `yarn start`

Runs the frontend in the development mode.\
Editing will reprocess and serve up the changes.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
