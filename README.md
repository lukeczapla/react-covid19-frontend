Code was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The program includes components for infection modelling with the HTML5 canvas (and graphs with react-plotly) 
and modifications of a simple tic-tac-toe example.
## Available Scripts

In the project folder, you can run:

### `update`

Simple script builds the production code and moves it into the main webapp folder for a website.

### `yarn start`

Runs the system in the development mode.\
Editing will reprocess and serve up the changes.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
